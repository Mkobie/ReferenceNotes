# Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

## Basic principals
- Encapsulation - grouping related data & functions
  - Memory aid: capsule pill - don't need to know what's inside
- Inheritance - can inherit encapsulated stuff
  - Memory aid: family tree
- Abstraction - simplify complex ideas; hide unimportant details
  - Memory aid: to drive you need to know how the steering wheel works, but don't need to know how the enigne works
- Polymorphism - fns behave differently depending on context they're called in
  - Memory aid: different cell phone all need to make calls
